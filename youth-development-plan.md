# Youth Development Plan

## Vision

All Sacramento children and youth are valued and reach their fullest potential.

## Mission

The City of Sacramento leads collaboratively to provide systemic and sustainable investments and opportunities, harnessing collective assets to champion intentional and equitable pathways for young people to succeed.

## Values

* **Youth Voice:** We honor the youth’s statement, "Nothing about us without us."
* **Elimination of Systemic Barriers:** We believe it is our responsibility to actively seek ways to break systemic barriers so that youth have access and ability to fully utilize resources and supports.
* **Cultural Humility:** We commit to acknowledging our individual and institutional biases, accepting that there are gaps in our knowledge, and being open to new ideas.
* **Mutual Respect:** We build relationships through developing a culture of mutual respect and inclusivity.
* **Integrity:** We believe in conducting our work in an honest, moral, ethical, and accountable manner.
* **Innovation:** The _status quo_ is unacceptable if it is not improving the lives of Sacramento children and youth, and thus, we call for thinking outside of the box to better support Sacramento’s youngest residents.
* **Courage:** We believe that having the audacity to take risks, stand up for what is right, and address the most challenging situations is unquestionable.

## Goals

Through its own programs and strategic partnerships, the City of Sacramento will strive to achieve the following goals.

* Contribute to the healthy development of children ages 0-5 so that they are prepared for school;
* Provide resources, support, and connection to effective programs and services that lead to success in education;
* Build 21st century skills including leadership, workforce development, life, resiliency, and social-emotional skills;
* Provide opportunities for young people to become active and engaged community members;
* Create a safe environment, both physically and emotionally, in all settings, honoring culture and community;
* Promote equity, justice, and accountability with a concerted application of resources toward those youth in greatest need;
* Empower families to engage in their children’s healthy development; and
* Implement the youth development framework in all program design, operations, and evaluation.

## Proposed Framework for Children and Youth Programs

When designing, implementing, and evaluating its children and youth programs, the City of Sacramento will strive to offer all young people, regardless of background, the highest-quality youth development experiences. To ensure these experiences result in positive outcomes, the City and its partners will provide youth with research-based supports and opportunities that integrate a set of social justice principles, aligning with the City’s core values, into staff, program delivery, and organizational/institutional practices.
