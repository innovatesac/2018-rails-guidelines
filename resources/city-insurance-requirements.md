Grantee and/or the sponsoring organization shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City of Sacramento, its officials, agents, employees and volunteers from and against all actions, losses, damages, liability, costs and expenses of every type and description, including, but not limited to, attorney’s fee, to which any or all of them may be subjected by reason of, or resulting from, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, the acts or omissions of the applicant, sponsoring organization, or its officers, agents, employees or volunteers directly or indirectly arising from the exercise of the authority under a RAILS Grant Agreement. 

**You must submit two \(2\) documents to satisfy insurance requirements \(**[**see examples**](https://github.com/innovatesac/2018-rails-guidelines/raw/master/assets/Insurance%20Examples.pdf)**\):**

1. **Certificate of Insurance** in the amount of $1 million worth of General Commercial Liability coverage must be submitted for the length of the grant agreement \(12 months\).

* The standard proof of insurance is the ACORD certificate form.
* The name of the insured, the insurance carrier, the policy number, coverage limits, and effective and expiration dates for the coverage must be stated on the certificate of insurance.
* If alcohol will be sold or consumed at an event, a $1 million liquor liability is required.
* Certificate holder must be listed on the certificate as City of Sacramento, 915 I Street, Sacramento, CA 95814.
* Insurance certificates must be signed by an authorized representative of the insurance carrier. Electronic signatures are acceptable.

2. **Additional Endorsement** is required to reflect that the insurance policy has been amended to include the City of Sacramento as insured.

* The Additional Endorsement must reference the policy number as it appears on the certificate.
* “The City of Sacramento, it’s officials, agents, employees and volunteers” must be named as additionally insured on the Additional Endorsement.

**Grant funds will not be dispersed until both the Certificate of Insurance and Additional Endorsement have been received.**
