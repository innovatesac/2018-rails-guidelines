# Grant Categories

## **Acceleration Grants \($50k to $250k\)**

For accelerator and incubator programs supporting Sacramento startups through mentorship, networking, and education to raise capital, grow their business, and create new jobs. Programs that accelerate the commercialization of emerging technologies also are eligible to apply.

## **Innovation Grants \($20k to $100k\)**

For civic tech companies and organizations making it easier to work with and in Sacramento; or for local organizations bringing together the innovation community in Sacramento. Startups that are focused on improving the quality of life in cities through the SUTL framework are encouraged to apply under this category.

## **Leadership Grants \($20k to $50k\)**

For educational programs training our next entrepreneurs in technology and business to build Sacramento-based startups. Programs that offer science, technology, engineering, arts, and math \(STEAM\) training to youth are eligible for funding under this category. These programs should also demonstrate how they integrate the youth development framework and one or more of the social justice principles outlined in the Citywide Youth Development Campaign Plan as an indication of a commitment to providing the highest quality program experience for participants.

The amount requested must be justified in the project budget portion of the application. Additionally, no grant request may exceed $250,000.

Projects can be new undertakings for the applicant or represent further development of a recent innovative direction. However, as a competitive application process, grantees must have a track record that demonstrates their commitment to advancing in their field and ability to execute.

## Cash Grant Match Requirement

There is a required minimum cash grant match of 1:1 for grants of $100,000 or more. The required match must comprise direct cash investment from the grantee or a third party. Any contribution other than cash — for example, in-kind support — does not count toward the cash grant match requirement. Applications for grants under $100,000 with leveraged funding sources may receive preference.
