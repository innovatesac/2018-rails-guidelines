# Grant Categories

Individuals, startups, companies, and nonprofits are invited to apply for grant funding in three areas:

* **Acceleration Grants \(up to $250k\):**for accelerator and incubator programs supporting Sacramento startups through mentorship, networking, and education to raise capital, grow their business, and create new jobs. Programs that accelerate the commercialization of emerging technologies also are eligible to apply.

* **Innovation Grants \(up to $50k\):**for civic tech companies and organizations making it easier to work with and in Sacramento; or for local organizations bringing together the innovation community in Sacramento. Startups that are focused on improving the quality of life in cities through the SUTL framework are encouraged to apply under this category.

* **Leadership Grants \(up to $25k\):**for educational programs training our next entrepreneurs in technology and business to build Sacramento-based startups. Programs that offer science, technology, engineering, arts, and math \(STEAM\) training to youth are eligible for funding under this category.

The amount requested must be justified in the project budget portion of the application. Additionally, no grant request may exceed $250,000. Applicants are not required to match the funds awarded through this grant, but applications with leveraged funding sources may receive preference.

Projects can be new undertakings for the applicant or represent further development of a recent innovative direction. However, as a competitive application process, grantees must have a track record that demonstrates their commitment to advancing in their field and ability to execute.

Applications also should be conceived with a hypothesis about how their proposal creates economic activity and are strongly encouraged to propose projects in the Cityâ€™s neighborhoods where small scale economic hubs may be developed. The Review Panel will consider geographic diversity in the overall allocation of funds.
