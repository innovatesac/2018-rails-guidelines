# Selection Process

## Application Evaluation

The City anticipates implementing the following process for reviewing and evaluating proposals:

1. City staff will review grant applications for completeness and eligibility. When necessary, applicants may be asked to revise proposals or supply additional information.
2. The Mayor’s Tech Council will review and score all eligible applications using the Innovation & Growth Fund Policy Guidelines and Criteria, and designate the highest-ranking applications as semi-finalists.
3. The Mayor's Tech Council will conduct a more in-depth review of semi-finalist applications using the RAILS Application Scoring Criteria, and designate the top 20 applications as finalists.
4. Finalist applicants will be invited to a Pitch Day event in which they will have five minutes to pitch their project and five minutes to answer questions from the Mayor's Tech Council.
5. The Mayor's Tech Council will nominate the top projects from Pitch Day and recommend preliminary awards and amounts to the City Council.
6. The City Council will vote to amend or adopt the preliminary awards and amounts.
7. The City Council's decisions about awards and amounts are final and not subject to appeal.

The City may modify this process in its sole discretion if, based on the number of applications submitted, the City determines that another process is more appropriate.
